## Speller

A small sinatra application who provides a text spellcheck service.

## Before start

We use Aspell to provide the spell checker service. You need to install it with
the dictionaries of your choice:

### OSX

```
brew install aspell --with-lang-es --with-lang-en --with-lang-pt-br
```

### Linux

```
sudo apt-get install aspell aspell-en aspell-es aspell-pt-br
```


## Startup!

```
bundle install
ruby speller.rb
```

## Endpoints

To consume the service, you could post ```[ROOT_URL]/spell``` endpoint, with the following params:

- text: Is the text you want to spellcheck.
- lang: Is the code of the lang who are you testing text, for example ```es```.

So, a full request could be:

```[ROOT_URL]/spell?lang=en&text=Bla%20Bla%20Bla%20Bla```

The response will be an array of possible suggestions:

```
[{"attrs":{"l":3,"o":0,"s":1},"suggestions":["Bela","Blah","Bola","Bl","Blab","Blag","Blat","BA","Ba","LA"]},{"attrs":{"l":3,"o":4,"s":1},"suggestions":["Bela","Blah","Bola","Bl","Blab","Blag","Blat","BA","Ba","LA"]},{"attrs":{"l":3,"o":8,"s":1},"suggestions":["Bela","Blah","Bola","Bl","Blab","Blag","Blat","BA","Ba","LA"]},{"attrs":{"l":3,"o":12,"s":1},"suggestions":["Bela","Blah","Bola","Bl","Blab","Blag","Blat","BA","Ba","LA"]}]
```
